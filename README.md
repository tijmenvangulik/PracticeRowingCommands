# App to practice Rowing (coxing) commands
## (App voor het Oefenen roeien stuur commando's)

Little serious game to practice rowing coxing commands. 

The website:
[https://ergometer-space.org/PracticeRowingCommands](https://ergometer-space.org/PracticeRowingCommands)

Written in godot

The current language is still dutch but more language will be Edit the translations Translations.cv to add more languages or rowing club specific commands.
The translations can be found [here](/translations/Translations.csv) This is a csv file which you can load in a spread sheet. You can send the translated version to me.
You can also define a button set in this file for each language.

Some help needed translating the app to different languages and rowing club slang.

Press f1 in the game for debug mode

The first version was written in [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/578632637/)
