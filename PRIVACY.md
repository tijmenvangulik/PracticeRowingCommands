# Privacy

This app does not use cookies or collects data to identify user. Most of your data and settings stays in the browser. 

Wat is collected:
* Public high scores only when you confirm that you want to publish your high score. You have to fill in a name but you can fill in any name to keep it private
* When you a send feedback to creator the exact information which you fill in into the form.
* When you finish a practice I will collect anonymous information which is used to see if the app is used. What is logged:
  * Date/time
  * De practice name
  * The language
* When sharing your settings the settings are stored on the server. You can work around this by un checking the "short settings link" in the settings. When you do this all the settings are placed in the url. This prevents sending your settings to the server.
